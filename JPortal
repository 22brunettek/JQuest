//Class JPortal by @tiffu-coder and @22brunettek

//JPortal is the portal used to travel through time. Screen is divided into thirds, with the left third displaying the timelines and the right third displaying the JPortal image.
//Will present images that represent different timelines to travel to that the player can then select. Will then transport player to the timeline, returning the select timeline 
//to the server. Images are shown in a display screen with scroll buttons to access the different timelines. When timeline is selected, image will appear in JPortal and then the 
//screen will fade to black, say welcome to x-timeline, and then return to menu. If the player does nothing for 30 seconds, the screen will fade to black and return to the menu. 
//Some timelines will be locked and must be unlocked later.
